# Hackathon Brief: FlowState Studio

**Goal:**
A small web app that lets users start/stop “flow sessions” (coding, studying, creating), tag them with activity + mood + soundtrack, and then visualise their day as an animated timeline of sessions. All data can stay local (localStorage), and the focus is on making the sessions *look* and *feel* like a curated vibe reel rather than just a boring tracker.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Backend: No backend (Local State / localStorage)
- Data: localStorage

**Design & Vibe:**
- Style keywords: retro VHS x neon cyberpunk
- Elements: scanlines, soft glow, subtle glitch transitions, gradient backgrounds
- Mood: “late-night code session with lo-fi + CRT monitor” energy

**Constraints:**
- Time limit: Hackathon mode (shipping > perfection).
- No placeholder code.
- Avoid overengineering.
