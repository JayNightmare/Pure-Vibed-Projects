# 😎 Pure Vibes 😎

> Projects built for speed and vibes.

## Overview

This repository is a collection of experiments, hackathon entries, and rapid prototypes built with one core philosophy: **Vibes First**.

We aren't chasing 100% test coverage or enterprise-grade architecture here. We are chasing the spark of an idea, the flow state of coding, and the joy of shipping something that looks and feels great.

### What is "Vibe Coding"?
- **Speed over Perfection**: If it works and looks cool, ship it.
- **Playful UI/UX**: Interfaces that pop, bounce, and delight.
- **Minimal Friction**: Simple tech stacks, zero boilerplate, maximum output.

### The Projects
Each directory in this repo represents a standalone "Vibe Check"—a distinct project tackling a specific idea or hackathon prompt. Check the individual folders for setup instructions and demos.
